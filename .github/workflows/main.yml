# This is a workflow showing most of lowlighter/metrics features
# If you forked this repository, you should only keep the "github-metrics-personal" job, 
# and delete the "github-metrics" as it is only used to generate examples
#
# See https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/action.yml for full options reference
# See https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics for additional documentation
# 
# You'll notice that my workflow use a lot of different tokens :
# - GITHUB_TOKEN which is an auto-generated token provided by GitHub used to commit your metrics on your repository
# - METRICS_TOKEN which is my personal scope-less token  
# - METRICS_BOT_TOKEN which is a bot account token with more scopes that I use for plugins which requires additional scopes
# 
# There are also a few application tokens : 
# - PAGESPEED_TOKEN which is a PageSpeed API token (optional for "plugin_pagespeed")
# - TWITTER_TOKEN which is twitter API token (mandatory for "plugin_tweets")
# - SPOTIFY_TOKENS which contains a client_id, client_secret and a refresh_token for Spotify (mandatory for some mode of "plugin_music")
#
# The workflow is planned for every hour, but you can change its frequency if you want, 
# though it's useless to put something lower than 15 minutes as your rendered metrics will probably still be cached by GitHub
#
# It will also run on each manual commit on "master" branch
